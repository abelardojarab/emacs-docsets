<h2 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph">
<p>This command updates the index using the current content found in
the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.
It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole,
but with some options it can also be used to add content with
only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or
remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it
is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit.  Thus
after making any changes to the working directory, and before running
the commit command, you must use the <tt>add</tt> command to add any new or
modified files to the index.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command can be performed multiple times before a commit.  It only
adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command is
run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then
you must run <tt>git add</tt> again to add the new content to the index.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <tt>git status</tt> command can be used to obtain a summary of which
files have changes that are staged for the next commit.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <tt>git add</tt> command will not add ignored files by default.  If any
ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line, <tt>git add</tt>
will fail with a list of ignored files.  Ignored files reached by
directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git (quote your
globs before the shell) will be silently ignored.  The <em>git add</em> command can
be used to add ignored files with the <tt>-f</tt> (force) option.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please see <a href="git-commit.html">git-commit(1)</a> for alternative ways to add content to a
commit.

operation to a subset of the working tree. See Interactive
mode for details.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-p</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">--patch</dt>
<dd><p>Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the
work tree and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance
to review the difference before adding modified contents to the
index.</p><div class="paragraph">
<p></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This effectively runs <tt>add --interactive</tt>, but bypasses the
initial command menu and directly jumps to the <tt>patch</tt> subcommand.
See Interactive mode for details.

<dt class="hdlist1">-e, --edit</dt>

edit it.  After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers
and apply the patch to the index.</p><div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The intent of this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to
apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be staged. This can be
quicker and more flexible than using the interactive hunk selector.
However, it is easy to confuse oneself and create a patch that does not
apply to the index. See EDITING PATCHES below.

2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list.  If the second number in a range is

<div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph">
<p>Invoking <tt>git add -e</tt> or selecting <tt>e</tt> from the interactive hunk
selector will open a patch in your editor; after the editor exits, the
result is applied to the index. You are free to make arbitrary changes
to the patch, but note that some changes may have confusing results, or
even result in a patch that cannot be applied.  If you want to abort the
operation entirely (i.e., stage nothing new in the index), simply delete
all lines of the patch. The list below describes some common things you
may see in a patch, and which editing operations make sense on them.

prevent staging their removal by converting the "-" to a " " (space).</p></dd>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also more complex operations that can be performed. But beware
that because the patch is applied only to the index and not the working
tree, the working tree will appear to "undo" the change in the index.
For example, introducing a new line into the index that is in neither
the HEAD nor the working tree will stage the new line for commit, but
the line will appear to be reverted in the working tree.
