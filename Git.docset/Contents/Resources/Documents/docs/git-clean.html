<h3 id="_synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h3>
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content"><em>git clean</em> [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e &lt;pattern&gt;] [-x | -X] [--] &lt;path&gt;...</pre>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not
under version control, starting from the current directory.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the <em>-x</em>
option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for
example, be useful to remove all build products.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any optional <tt>&lt;path&gt;...</tt> arguments are given, only those paths
are affected.

<h3 id="_options">OPTIONS</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">-d</dt>
<dd><p>Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git
repository, it is not removed by default.  Use -f option twice
if you really want to remove such a directory.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-f</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">--force</dt>
<dd><p>If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set
to false, <em>git clean</em> will refuse to run unless given -f, -n or
-i.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-i</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">--interactive</dt>
<dd><p>Show what would be done and clean files interactively. See
Interactive mode for details.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-n</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">--dry-run</dt>
<dd><p>Don't actually remove anything, just show what would be done.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-q</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">--quiet</dt>
<dd><p>Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are
successfully removed.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-e &lt;pattern&gt;</dt>
<dt class="hdlist1">--exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;</dt>
<dd><p>In addition to those found in .gitignore (per directory) and
$GIT_DIR/info/exclude, also consider these patterns to be in the
set of the ignore rules in effect.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-x</dt>
<dd><p>Don't use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per
directory) and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, but do still use the ignore
rules given with <tt>-e</tt> options.  This allows removing all untracked
files, including build products.  This can be used (possibly in
conjunction with <em>git reset</em>) to create a pristine
working directory to test a clean build.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">-X</dt>
<dd><p>Remove only files ignored by Git.  This may be useful to rebuild
everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.</p></dd>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_interactive_mode">Interactive mode</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the
files and directories to be cleaned, and goes into its
interactive command loop.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and
gives a prompt "What now&gt; ".  In general, when the prompt ends
with a single <em>&gt;</em>, you can pick only one of the choices given
and type return, like this:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    *** Commands ***
	1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers
	4: ask each             5: quit                 6: help
    What now&gt; 1
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also could say <tt>c</tt> or <tt>clean</tt> above as long as the choice is unique.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main command loop has 6 subcommands.
</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">clean</dt>
<dd><p>Start cleaning files and directories, and then quit.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">filter by pattern</dt>
<dd><p>This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an
"Input ignore patterns&gt;&gt;" prompt. You can input space-seperated
patterns to exclude files and directories from deletion.
E.g. "<strong>.c </strong>.h" will excludes files end with ".c" and ".h" from
deletion. When you are satisfied with the filtered result, press
ENTER (empty) back to the main menu.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">select by numbers</dt>
<dd><p>This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an
"Select items to delete&gt;&gt;" prompt. When the prompt ends with double
<em>&gt;&gt;</em> like this, you can make more than one selection, concatenated
with whitespace or comma.  Also you can say ranges.  E.g. "2-5 7,9"
to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list.  If the second number in a
range is omitted, all remaining items are selected.  E.g. "7-" to
choose 7,8,9 from the list.  You can say <em>*</em> to choose everything.
Also when you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER
(empty) back to the main menu.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ask each</dt>
<dd><p>This will start to clean, and you must confirm one by one in order
to delete items. Please note that this action is not as efficient
as the above two actions.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">quit</dt>
<dd><p>This lets you quit without do cleaning.</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">help</dt>
<dd><p>Show brief usage of interactive git-clean.</p></dd>
