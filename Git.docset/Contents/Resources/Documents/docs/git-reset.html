can copy the contents of a path out of a commit to the index and to the
working tree in one go.

<p>"reset --merge" is meant to be used when resetting out of a conflicted
merge. Any mergy operation guarantees that the working tree file that is
involved in the merge does not have local change wrt the index before
it starts, and that it writes the result out to the working tree. So if
we see some difference between the index and the target and also
between the index and the working tree, then it means that we are not
resetting out from a state that a mergy operation left after failing
with a conflict. That is why we disallow --merge option in this case.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"reset --keep" is meant to be used when removing some of the last
commits in the current branch while keeping changes in the working
tree. If there could be conflicts between the changes in the commit we
want to remove and the changes in the working tree we want to keep,
the reset is disallowed. That's why it is disallowed if there are both
changes between the working tree and HEAD, and between HEAD and the
target. To be safe, it is also disallowed when there are unmerged
entries.
