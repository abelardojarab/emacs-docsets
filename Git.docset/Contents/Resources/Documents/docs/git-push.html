<p>Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can make interesting things happen to a repository
every time you push into it, by setting up <em>hooks</em> there.  See
documentation for <a href="git-receive-pack.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the command line does not specify where to push with the
<tt>&lt;repository&gt;</tt> argument, <tt>branch.*.remote</tt> configuration for the
current branch is consulted to determine where to push.  If the
configuration is missing, it defaults to <em>origin</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the command line does not specify what to push with <tt>&lt;refspec&gt;...</tt>
arguments or <tt>--all</tt>, <tt>--mirror</tt>, <tt>--tags</tt> options, the command finds
the default <tt>&lt;refspec&gt;</tt> by consulting <tt>remote.*.push</tt> configuration,
and if it is not found, honors <tt>push.default</tt> configuration to decide
what to push (See git<a href="git-config">1</a> for the meaning of <tt>push.default</tt>).

<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
<h3 id="_options">OPTIONS</h3>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">&lt;repository&gt;</dt>
<dd><p>The "remote" repository that is destination of a push
operation.  This parameter can be either a URL
(see the section <a href="#URLS">GIT URLS</a> below) or the name
of a remote (see the section <a href="#REMOTES">REMOTES</a> below).</p></dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">&lt;refspec&gt;...</dt>
<dd><p>Specify what destination ref to update with what source object.
The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
<tt>+</tt>, followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;, followed
by a colon <tt>:</tt>, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.</p><div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but
it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such as <tt>master~4</tt> or
<tt>HEAD</tt> (see <a href="gitrevisions.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>).
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this
push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must
be named. If <tt>:</tt>&lt;dst&gt; is omitted, the same ref as &lt;src&gt; will be
updated.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the &lt;dst&gt; reference
on the remote side.  By default this is only allowed if &lt;dst&gt; is not
a tag (annotated or lightweight), and then only if it can fast-forward
&lt;dst&gt;.  By having the optional leading <tt>+</tt>, you can tell Git to update
the &lt;dst&gt; ref even if it is not allowed by default (e.g., it is not a
fast-forward.)  This does <strong>not</strong> attempt to merge &lt;src&gt; into &lt;dst&gt;.  See
EXAMPLES below for details.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><tt>tag &lt;tag&gt;</tt> means the same as <tt>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</tt>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt; ref from
the remote repository.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special refspec <tt>:</tt> (or <tt>+:</tt> to allow non-fast-forward updates)
directs Git to push "matching" branches: for every branch that exists on
the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of the same name
already exists on the remote side.

<dd><p>Remove remote branches that don't have a local counterpart. For example
a remote branch <tt>tmp</tt> will be removed if a local branch with the same
name doesn't exist any more. This also respects refspecs, e.g.
<tt>git push --prune remote refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/*</tt> would
make sure that remote <tt>refs/tmp/foo</tt> will be removed if <tt>refs/heads/foo</tt>
doesn't exist.</p></dd>

be mirrored to the remote repository.  Newly created local
refs will be pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs
will be force updated on the remote end, and deleted refs
will be removed from the remote end.  This is the default

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published.
You will have to bypass the "must fast-forward" rule in order to
replace the history you originally published with the rebased history.
If somebody else built on top of your original history while you are
rebasing, the tip of the branch at the remote may advance with her
commit, and blindly pushing with <tt>--force</tt> will lose her work.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are
updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref
still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no
other people did anything to the ref (it is like taking a "lease" on
the ref without explicitly locking it, and you update the ref while
making sure that your earlier "lease" is still valid).
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><tt>--force-with-lease</tt> alone, without specifying the details, will protect
all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring their
current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have
for them, unless specified with a <tt>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</tt>
option that explicitly states what the expected value is.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><tt>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</tt>, without specifying the expected value, will
protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
requiring its current value to be the same as the remote-tracking
branch we have for it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><tt>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</tt> will protect the named ref (alone),
if it is going to be updated, by requiring its current value to be
the same as the specified value &lt;expect&gt; (which is allowed to be
different from the remote-tracking branch we have for the refname,
or we do not even have to have such a remote-tracking branch when
this form is used).
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that all forms other than <tt>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</tt>

still experimental and their semantics may change as we gain experience
with this feature.

other than the current branch (including local refs that are
strictly behind their remote counterpart).  To force a push to only
one branch, use a <tt>+</tt> in front of the refspec to push (e.g <tt>git push

<a name="URLS"></a>
<h3 id="_git_urls">GIT URLS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
address of the remote server, and the path to the repository.
Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be
absent.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp,
and ftps can be used for fetching and rsync can be used for fetching
and pushing, but these are inefficient and deprecated; do not use
them).
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
should be used with caution on unsecured networks.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following syntaxes may be used with them:
</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li><p>ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:
</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li><p>[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a
colon. For example the local path <tt>foo:bar</tt> could be specified as an
absolute path or <tt>./foo:bar</tt> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh
url.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:
</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li><p>ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>[user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following
syntaxes may be used:
</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li><p>/path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
<li><p>\file:///path/to/repo.git/</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when
the former implies --local option. See <a href="git-clone.html">git-clone(1)</a> for
details.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Git doesn't know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
attempts to use the <em>remote-&lt;transport&gt;</em> remote helper, if one
exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax
may be used:
</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li><p>&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
invoked. See <a href="gitremote-helpers.html">gitremote-helpers(1)</a> for details.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you
use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a
configuration section of the form:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	[url "&lt;actual url base&gt;"]
		insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, with this:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	[url "git://git.host.xz/"]
		insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
		insteadOf = work:
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
configuration section of the form:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	[url "&lt;actual url base&gt;"]
		pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, with this:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	[url "ssh://example.org/"]
		pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
"ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
use the original URL.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a name="REMOTES"></a>
<h3 id="_remotes">REMOTES</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name of one of the following can be used instead
of a URL as <tt>&lt;repository&gt;</tt> argument:

<h3 id="_note_about_fast-forwards">Note about fast-forwards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to
point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the original
commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new commit B
builds on top of.  Hence, it does not lose any history.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history.  For example,
suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you built
a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history
leading to commit A.  The history looks like this:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>
      B
     /
 ---X---A

</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to A
back to the original repository from which you two obtained the original
commit X.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point at
commit X to point at commit A.  It is a fast-forward.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that
now points at A) with commit B.  This does <em>not</em> fast-forward.  If you did
so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody
will now start building on top of B.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command by default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward
to prevent such loss of history.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) nor the work by
the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first fetch the
history from the repository, create a history that contains changes done
by both parties, and push the result back.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push"
the result.  A "git pull" will create a merge commit C between commits A
and B.
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>
      B---C
     /   /
 ---X---A

</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your
push will be accepted.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A,
with "git pull --rebase", and push the result back.  The rebase will
create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of
A.
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>
      B   D
     /   /
 ---X---A

</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be
accepted.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another common situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward
rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even when you are
pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit
A yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it with "git
commit --amend" to produce commit B, and you try to push it out, because
forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if
you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A
(and started building on top of it), you can run "git push --force" to
overwrite it. In other words, "git push --force" is a method reserved for
a case where you do mean to lose history.
