<h3 id="_description">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>List commits that are reachable by following the <tt>parent</tt> links from the
given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s)
given with a <em>^</em> in front of them.  The output is given in reverse
chronological order by default.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can think of this as a set operation.  Commits given on the command
line form a set of commits that are reachable from any of them, and then
commits reachable from any of the ones given with <em>^</em> in front are
subtracted from that set.  The remaining commits are what comes out in the
command's output.  Various other options and paths parameters can be used
to further limit the result.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, the following command:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	$ git rev-list foo bar ^baz
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>means "list all the commits which are reachable from <em>foo</em> or <em>bar</em>, but
not from <em>baz</em>".
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A special notation "<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>..<em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>" can be used as a
short-hand for "^<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em> <em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>". For example, either of
the following may be used interchangeably:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	$ git rev-list origin..HEAD
	$ git rev-list HEAD ^origin
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another special notation is "<em>&lt;commit1&gt;</em>...<em>&lt;commit2&gt;</em>" which is useful
for merges.  The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference
between the two operands.  The following two commands are equivalent:
</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	$ git rev-list A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
	$ git rev-list A...B
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>rev-list</em> is a very essential Git command, since it
provides the ability to build and traverse commit ancestry graphs. For
this reason, it has a lot of different options that enables it to be
used by commands as different as <em>git bisect</em> and
<em>git repack</em>.

<p>Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the

limiting may be applied.

<p>Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
<tt>--since=&lt;date1&gt;</tt> limits to commits newer than <tt>&lt;date1&gt;</tt>, and using it

has a line that matches <tt>&lt;pattern&gt;</tt>), unless otherwise noted.

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent of
each merge.  The commits are:

* `I` is the initial commit, in which `foo` exists with contents
  ``asdf'', and a file `quux` exists with contents ``quux''. Initial
  commits are compared to an empty tree, so `I` is !TREESAME.

* In `A`, `foo` contains just ``foo''.

* `B` contains the same change as `A`.  Its merge `M` is trivial and
  hence TREESAME to all parents.

* `C` does not change `foo`, but its merge `N` changes it to ``foobar'',
  so it is not TREESAME to any parent.

* `D` sets `foo` to ``baz''. Its merge `O` combines the strings from
  `N` and `D` to ``foobarbaz''; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.

* `E` changes `quux` to ``xyzzy'', and its merge `P` combines the
  strings to ``quux xyzzy''. `P` is TREESAME to `O`, but not to `E`.

* `X` is an independent root commit that added a new file `side`, and `Y`
  modified it. `Y` is TREESAME to `X`. Its merge `Q` added `side` to `P`, and
  `Q` is TREESAME to `P`, but not to `Y`.

`rev-list` walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether `--full-history` and/or parent rewriting
(via `--parents` or `--children`) are used. The following settings
are available.

Default mode::
	Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent
	(though this can be changed, see `--sparse` below).  If the
	commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow
	only that parent.  (Even if there are several TREESAME
	parents, follow only one of them.)  Otherwise, follow all
	parents.
+
This results in:

</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed `B` from consideration entirely.  `C` was
considered via `N`, but is TREESAME.  Root commits are compared to an
empty tree, so `I` is !TREESAME.
+
Parent/child relations are only visible with `--parents`, but that does
not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.

--full-history without parent rewriting::
	This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow
	all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them.
	Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are
	included, this does not imply that the merge itself is!  In
	the example, we get

`M` was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.  `E`,
`C` and `B` were all walked, but only `B` was !TREESAME, so the others
do not appear.
+
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
them disconnected.

--full-history with parent rewriting::
	Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
	(though this can be changed, see `--sparse` below).
+
Merges are always included.  However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
themselves.  This results in

Compare to `--full-history` without rewriting above.  Note that `E`
was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was
rewritten to contain `E`'s parent `I`.  The same happened for `C` and
`N`, and `X`, `Y` and `Q`.

In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
affects inclusion:

--dense::
	Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME
	to any parent.

--sparse::
	All commits that are walked are included.
+
Note that without `--full-history`, this still simplifies merges: if
one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other
sides of the merge are never walked.

--simplify-merges::
	First, build a history graph in the same way that
	`--full-history` with parent rewriting does (see above).
+
Then simplify each commit `C` to its replacement `C'` in the final
history according to the following rules:
+
--
* Set `C'` to `C`.
+
* Replace each parent `P` of `C'` with its simplification `P'`.  In
  the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are
  root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take care
  to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.
+
* If after this parent rewriting, `C'` is a root or merge commit (has
  zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains.
  Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.
--
+
The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
`--full-history` with parent rewriting.  The example turns into:
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	  .-A---M---N---O
	 /     /       /
	I     B       D
	 \   /       /
	  `---------'
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
Note the major differences in `N`, `P`, and `Q` over `--full-history`:
+
--
* `N`'s parent list had `I` removed, because it is an ancestor of the
  other parent `M`.  Still, `N` remained because it is !TREESAME.
+
* `P`'s parent list similarly had `I` removed.  `P` was then
  removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.
+
* `Q`'s parent list had `Y` simplified to `X`. `X` was then removed, because it
  was a TREESAME root. `Q` was then removed completely, because it had one
  parent and is TREESAME.
--

Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:

--ancestry-path::
	Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry
	chain between the ``from'' and ``to'' commits in the given commit
	range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the ``to''
	commit and descendants of the ``from'' commit.
+
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	    D---E-------F
	   /     \       \
	  B---C---G---H---I---J
	 /                     \
	A-------K---------------L--M
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
A regular 'D..M' computes the set of commits that are ancestors of `M`,
but excludes the ones that are ancestors of `D`. This is useful to see
what happened to the history leading to `M` since `D`, in the sense
that ``what does `M` have that did not exist in `D`''. The result in this
example would be all the commits, except `A` and `B` (and `D` itself,
of course).
+
When we want to find out what commits in `M` are contaminated with the
bug introduced by `D` and need fixing, however, we might want to view
only the subset of 'D..M' that are actually descendants of `D`, i.e.
excluding `C` and `K`. This is exactly what the `--ancestry-path`
option does. Applied to the 'D..M' range, it results in:
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>		E-------F
		 \       \
		  G---H---I---J
			       \
				L--M
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>
The `--simplify-by-decoration` option allows you to view only the
big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits
that are not referenced by tags.  Commits are marked as !TREESAME
(in other words, kept after history simplification rules described
above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the
contents of the paths given on the command line.  All other
commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).

Bisection Helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--bisect::
	Limit output to the one commit object which is roughly halfway between
	included and excluded commits. Note that the bad bisection ref
	`refs/bisect/bad` is added to the included commits (if it
	exists) and the good bisection refs `refs/bisect/good-*` are
	added to the excluded commits (if they exist). Thus, supposing there
	are no refs in `refs/bisect/`, if
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	$ git rev-list --bisect foo ^bar ^baz
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
outputs 'midpoint', the output of the two commands
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	$ git rev-list foo ^midpoint
	$ git rev-list midpoint ^bar ^baz
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
would be of roughly the same length.  Finding the change which
introduces a regression is thus reduced to a binary search: repeatedly
generate and test new 'midpoint's until the commit chain is of length
one.

--bisect-vars::
	This calculates the same as `--bisect`, except that refs in
	`refs/bisect/` are not used, and except that this outputs
	text ready to be eval'ed by the shell. These lines will assign the
	name of the midpoint revision to the variable `bisect_rev`, and the
	expected number of commits to be tested after `bisect_rev` is tested
	to `bisect_nr`, the expected number of commits to be tested if
	`bisect_rev` turns out to be good to `bisect_good`, the expected
	number of commits to be tested if `bisect_rev` turns out to be bad to
	`bisect_bad`, and the number of commits we are bisecting right now to
	`bisect_all`.

--bisect-all::
	This outputs all the commit objects between the included and excluded
	commits, ordered by their distance to the included and excluded
	commits. Refs in `refs/bisect/` are not used. The farthest
	from them is displayed first. (This is the only one displayed by
	`--bisect`.)
+
This is useful because it makes it easy to choose a good commit to
test when you want to avoid to test some of them for some reason (they
may not compile for example).
+
This option can be used along with `--bisect-vars`, in this case,
after all the sorted commit objects, there will be the same text as if
`--bisect-vars` had been used alone.


Commit Ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.

--date-order::
	Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
	otherwise show commits in the commit timestamp order.

--author-date-order::
	Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
	otherwise show commits in the author timestamp order.

--topo-order::
	Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and
	avoid showing commits on multiple lines of history
	intermixed.
+
For example, in a commit history like this:
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>    ---1----2----4----7
	\	       \
	 3----5----6----8---
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
where the numbers denote the order of commit timestamps, `git
rev-list` and friends with `--date-order` show the commits in the
timestamp order: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.
+
With `--topo-order`, they would show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4 2 6 5
3 1); some older commits are shown before newer ones in order to
avoid showing the commits from two parallel development track mixed
together.

--reverse::
	Output the commits in reverse order.
	Cannot be combined with `--walk-reflogs`.

Object Traversal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options are mostly targeted for packing of Git repositories.

--objects::
	Print the object IDs of any object referenced by the listed
	commits.  `--objects foo ^bar` thus means ``send me
	all object IDs which I need to download if I have the commit
	object _bar_ but not _foo_''.

--objects-edge::
	Similar to `--objects`, but also print the IDs of excluded
	commits prefixed with a ``-'' character.  This is used by
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1] to build ``thin'' pack, which records
	objects in deltified form based on objects contained in these
	excluded commits to reduce network traffic.

--unpacked::
	Only useful with `--objects`; print the object IDs that are not
	in packs.

--no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]::
	Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their ancestors.
	This has no effect if a range is specified. If the argument
	`unsorted` is given, the commits are shown in the order they were
	given on the command line. Otherwise (if `sorted` or no argument
	was given), the commits are shown in reverse chronological order
	by commit time.

--do-walk::
	Overrides a previous `--no-walk`.

Commit Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using these options, linkgit:git-rev-list[1] will act similar to the
more specialized family of commit log tools: linkgit:git-log[1],
linkgit:git-show[1], and linkgit:git-whatchanged[1]

--pretty[=&lt;format&gt;]::
--format=&lt;format&gt;::

	Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format,
	where '&lt;format&gt;' can be one of 'oneline', 'short', 'medium',
	'full', 'fuller', 'email', 'raw' and 'format:&lt;string&gt;'.  See
	the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each
	format.  When omitted, the format defaults to 'medium'.
+
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
configuration (see linkgit:git-config[1]).

--abbrev-commit::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object
	name, show only a partial prefix.  Non default number of
	digits can be specified with "--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;" (which also modifies
	diff output, if it is displayed).
+
This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for
people using 80-column terminals.

--no-abbrev-commit::
	Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
	`--abbrev-commit` and those options which imply it such as
	"--oneline". It also overrides the 'log.abbrevCommit' variable.

--oneline::
	This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit"
	used together.

--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;::
	The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message
	in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the
	command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding
	preferred by the user.  For non plumbing commands this
	defaults to UTF-8.

--notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]::
	Show the notes (see linkgit:git-notes[1]) that annotate the
	commit, when showing the commit log message.  This is the default
	for `git log`, `git show` and `git whatchanged` commands when
	there is no `--pretty`, `--format` nor `--oneline` option given
	on the command line.
+
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
'core.notesRef' and 'notes.displayRef' variables (or corresponding
environment overrides). See linkgit:git-config[1] for more details.
+
With an optional '&lt;ref&gt;' argument, show this notes ref instead of the
default notes ref(s). The ref is taken to be in `refs/notes/` if it
is not qualified.
+
Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are
being displayed. Examples: "--notes=foo" will show only notes from
"refs/notes/foo"; "--notes=foo --notes" will show both notes from
"refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s).

--no-notes::
	Do not show notes. This negates the above `--notes` option, by
	resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
	Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g.
	"--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar" will only show notes
	from "refs/notes/bar".

--show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]::
--[no-]standard-notes::
	These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes
	options instead.

--show-signature::
	Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature
	to `gpg --verify` and show the output.
--relative-date::
	Synonym for `--date=relative`.

--date=(relative|local|default|iso|rfc|short|raw)::
	Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such
	as when using `--pretty`. `log.date` config variable sets a default
	value for the log command's `--date` option.
+
`--date=relative` shows dates relative to the current time,
e.g. ``2 hours ago''.
+
`--date=local` shows timestamps in user's local time zone.
+
`--date=iso` (or `--date=iso8601`) shows timestamps in ISO 8601 format.
+
`--date=rfc` (or `--date=rfc2822`) shows timestamps in RFC 2822
format, often found in email messages.
+
`--date=short` shows only the date, but not the time, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
+
`--date=raw` shows the date in the internal raw Git format `%s %z` format.
+
`--date=default` shows timestamps in the original time zone
(either committer's or author's).

--header::
	Print the contents of the commit in raw-format; each record is
	separated with a NUL character.

--parents::
	Print also the parents of the commit (in the form "commit parent...").
	Also enables parent rewriting, see 'History Simplification' below.

--children::
	Print also the children of the commit (in the form "commit child...").
	Also enables parent rewriting, see 'History Simplification' below.

--timestamp::
	Print the raw commit timestamp.

--left-right::
	Mark which side of a symmetric diff a commit is reachable from.
	Commits from the left side are prefixed with `&lt;` and those from
	the right with `&gt;`.  If combined with `--boundary`, those
	commits are prefixed with `-`.
+
For example, if you have this topology:
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	     y---b---b  branch B
	    / \ /
	   /   .
	  /   / \
	 o---x---a---a  branch A
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>+
you would get an output like this:
+
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	$ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>	&gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
	&gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
	&lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
	&lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
	-yyyyyyy... 1st on b
	-xxxxxxx... 1st on a
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>
--graph::
	Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history
	on the left hand side of the output.  This may cause extra lines
	to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history
	to be drawn properly.
+
This enables parent rewriting, see 'History Simplification' below.
+
This implies the `--topo-order` option by default, but the
`--date-order` option may also be specified.

--count::
	Print a number stating how many commits would have been
	listed, and suppress all other output.  When used together
	with `--left-right`, instead print the counts for left and
	right commits, separated by a tab. When used together with
	`--cherry-mark`, omit patch equivalent commits from these
	counts and print the count for equivalent commits separated
	by a tab.

PRETTY FORMATS
</tt></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format
is not <em>oneline</em>, <em>email</em> or <em>raw</em>, an additional line is
inserted before the <em>Author:</em> line.  This line begins with
"Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed,
separated by spaces.  Note that the listed commits may not
necessarily be the list of the <strong>direct</strong> parent commits if you

respecting the <tt>auto</tt> settings of the former if we are going to a
terminal). <tt>auto</tt> alone (i.e. <tt>%C(auto)</tt>) will turn on auto coloring
on the next placeholders until the color is switched again.</p></li>
<li><p><em>%m</em>: left, right or boundary mark</p></li>
<li><p><em>%n</em>: newline</p></li>
<li><p><em>%%</em>: a raw <em>%</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>%x00</em>: print a byte from a hex code</p></li>
<li><p><em>%w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]])</em>: switch line wrapping, like the -w option of
<a href="git-shortlog.html">git-shortlog(1)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])</em>: make the next placeholder take at
least N columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary.
Optionally truncate at the beginning (ltrunc), the middle (mtrunc)
or the end (trunc) if the output is longer than N columns.
Note that truncating only works correctly with N &gt;= 2.</p></li>
<li><p><em>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>: make the next placeholder take at least until Nth
columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary</p></li>
<li><p><em>%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</em>, <em>%&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>: similar to <em>%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</em>, <em>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>
respectively, but padding spaces on the left</p></li>
<li><p><em>%&gt;&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</em>, <em>%&gt;&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>: similar to <em>%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</em>, <em>%&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>
respectively, except that if the next placeholder takes more spaces
than given and there are spaces on its left, use those spaces</p></li>
<li><p><em>%&gt;&lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</em>, <em>%&gt;&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>: similar to <em>% &lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</em>, <em>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</em>
respectively, but padding both sides (i.e. the text is centered)</p></li>

<p>The <em>tformat:</em> format works exactly like <em>format:</em>, except that it
provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics. In
other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a
newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries.
This means that the final entry of a single-line format will be properly
terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does.
For example:
</p>

<div class="listingblock">

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <tt>%</tt> in it is interpreted

equivalent:
